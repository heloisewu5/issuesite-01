Types of Anxiety Disorders

<BR>

<h2>■ General Anxiety Disorder (GAD) ■</h2>

<div class="list">
<ul class="myList">
  <li>Feeling restless, wound-up, or on-edge</li>
  <li>Being easily fatigued</li>
  <li>Having difficulty concentrating</li>
  <li>Being irritable</li>
  <li>Having headaches, muscle aches, stomachaches, or unexplained pains</li>
  <li>Difficulty controlling feelings of worry</li>
  <li>Having sleep problems, such as difficulty falling or staying asleep</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p id="bodytext">With GAD, you may feel extreme and unrealistic worry and tension — even if there’s nothing to trigger these feelings. Most days, you may worry a lot about various topics, including health, work, school and relationships. You may feel that the worry continues from one thing to the next.</p>

<BR>

<h2>■ Panic Disorder ■</h2>

<div class="list">
<ul class="myList">
  <li>Pounding or racing heart</li>
  <li>Sweating</li>
  <li>Trembling or tingling</li>
  <li>Chest pain</li>
  <li>Feelings of impending doom</li>
  <li>Feelings of being out of control</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p id="bodytext">People with panic disorder have frequent and unexpected panic attacks. Panic attacks are sudden periods of intense fear, discomfort, or sense of losing control even when there is no clear danger or trigger. Not everyone who experiences a panic attack will develop panic disorder. People with panic disorder often worry about when the next attack will happen and actively try to prevent future attacks by avoiding places, situations, or behaviors they associate with panic attacks. Panic attacks can occur as frequently as several times a day or as rarely as a few times a year.
</p>

<h2>■ Phobias ■</h2>

<div class="list">
<ul class="myList">
  <li>Feeling unsteady, dizzy, lightheaded or faint</li>
  <li>Feeling like you are choking</li>
  <li>A pounding heart, palpitations or accelerated heart rate.</li>
  <li>Chest pain or tightness in the chest</li>
  <li>Sweating</li>
  <li>Hot or cold flushes</li>
  <li>Shortness of breath or a smothering sensation</li>
  <li>Nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p id="bodytext">Phobias are an intense fear of certain situations or objects. Some of these fears may make sense, such as a fear of snakes. But often, the level of fear doesn’t match the situation. Like with other anxiety disorders, you may spend a lot of time trying to avoid situations that may trigger the phobia. A specific phobia, or a simple phobia, is an intense fear of a particular object or situation. It may cause you to avoid everyday situations. Some specific phobias include fear of: animals, such as spiders, dogs or snakes, blood, flying, heights, and injections (shots).</p>

<h2>■ Social Anxiety Disorder ■</h2>

<div class="list">
<ul class="myList">
  <li>Blushing, sweating, or trembling</li>
  <li>Pounding or racing heart</li>
  <li>Stomachaches</li>
  <li>Rigid body posture or speaking with an overly soft voice</li>
  <li>Difficulty making eye contact or being around people they don’t know</li>
  <li>Feelings of self-consciousness or fear that people will judge them negatively</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p id="bodytext">Social anxiety disorder is an intense, persistent fear of being watched and judged by others. For people with social anxiety disorder, the fear of social situations may feel so intense that it seems beyond their control. For some people, this fear may get in the way of going to work, attending school, or doing everyday things.</p>

Levels of Anxiety

        <p>Mild Anxiety</p>
        <p id="bodytext4">Although often described as sub-clinical or clinically non-significant, mild anxiety can impact emotional, social and professional functioning. Mild anxiety symptoms may present as social anxiety or shyness and can be experienced in early childhood through to adulthood. If left unaddressed, mild anxiety can lead to maladaptive coping strategies or more severe mental conditions.

<div class="hoverContainer" id="div2">
  <button class="buttonB" >Moderate Anxiety</button>
    <div class="infoPopup">
      <div class="popupInner">
        <p>Moderate Anxiety</p>
        <p id="bodytext4">People with moderate levels of anxiety have more frequent or persistent symptoms than those with mild anxiety, but still have better daily functioning than someone with severe anxiety or panic disorder. For example, people with moderate anxiety may report experiencing symptoms such as feeling on edge, being unable to control their worrying or being unable to relax several days or the majority of days in a week, but not every day. Although moderate anxiety symptoms are disruptive, people with moderate anxiety may have success in managing their anxiety with the help of a doctor or self-help strategies.

<div class="hoverContainer" id="div3">
  <button class="buttonB" >Severe Anxiety</button>
    <div class="infoPopup">
      <div class="popupInner">
        <p>Severe Anxiety</p>
        <p id="bodytext4">Severe anxiety is intensely debilitating, and symptoms of severe anxiety meet key diagnostic criteria for clinically-significant anxiety disorder. People with severe anxiety typically score higher on scales of distress and lower on functioning. Severe anxiety symptoms also frequently co-occur with major depression, which can contribute to greater disability. Symptoms of severe anxiety are frequent and persistent and may include increased heart rate, feelings of panic and social withdrawal. These symptoms can result in loss of work and increased health care costs. In addition, individuals with severe anxiety may turn to alcohol and drugs as a means to cope with their symptoms.
